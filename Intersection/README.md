This simulation is an extension of the project "Intersection" available here: 'https://hash.ai/@hash/traffic-intersection'. 

The idea is to simulate the behavior of cars that appear at the intersection of roads (see `create_roads.py` for the creation of roads, `generate_cars.py` for the generation of cars). At each intersection, they face a signal (`signal.py`), red or green, that prevent/allow them to cross. 

They then have the possibility to turn at the intersection (see `car.py` to understand the cars behavior). 

*At any time of the simulation, cars ride on roads (`road.py` is empty, but could be use to give certain behaviors to roads.)*
